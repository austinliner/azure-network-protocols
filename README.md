<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<
<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create a Windows and a Linux VM on the same VNet.
- Using Remote Desktop, install Wireshark on the Windows VM.
- Configure a firewall on your Linux VM to disable inbound ICMP traffic.
- Observe the ICMP traffic using Wireshark, as well as other network protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S)
